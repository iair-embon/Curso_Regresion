# consider the following regression:

# log(weight) = - 3.5 + 2.0 log(height) + error

# (errors have standard deviation 0.25)

# A - Fill in the blanks: approximately 68% of the persons will have weights within a factor of
# __ and __ of their predicted values from the regression.

# 68 = 1 sd, so...
-(exp(0.25)) # -1.28
exp(0.25)    # 1.28

# B - Draw the regression line and scatterplot of log(weight) versus log(height)that make sense and are 
# consistent with the fitted model. Be sure to label the axes of your graph
