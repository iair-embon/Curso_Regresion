# D - Interpret all models coefficients
# fit3 (interaction model): 
# Intercept: it has no direct interpretation since is negative. Represents the predicted average earn for females with 0 height
# height: a increase in one unit in height predicts an average increase in earn (/1000) of 0.36 
# male: being male predicts a decrease of earnings in average -16.01 ??? if I plot it looks like the earn will increase
# interaction...: ?

# fit4:
# intercept: it has no direct interpretation since is negative. Represents the predicted average earn for females with 0 height
# height: a increase in one unit in height predicts an average increase in earn (/1000) of 0.55 (being female?)
# male: being male predicts an average increase in earn of 11.25
